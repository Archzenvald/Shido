*Shīdo* (*シード*) is a 3D game framework which aims to be simple and powerful. It shares similarities with the https://love2d.org/[LÖVE] framework.

One key principle of the framework is to expose and work at different levels of abstraction.

.The framework is made up of:
- A *C* API, the *shido* shared/dynamic library.
- A Lua(JIT) API, built on the *C* API with the FFI.
- A runtime environment to launch an app.

NOTE: The *C* library, although independently usable, is not designed to be a standalone API for the framework. The Lua API is at the highest level and calls the C API, thus some parts of the framework may be exclusively written in Lua.

.The framework is built on some major dependencies:
- The https://www.libsdl.org/index.php[SDL2] library.
- The https://libuv.org/[libuv] event loop.
- The https://github.com/google/filament[Filament] rendering engine.
- The https://skia.org/[Skia] 2D graphics library.
- The https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3[Bullet Physics] engine.
- The http://luajit.org/luajit.html[LuaJIT] (2.1) VM.

.Available runtime dynamic libraries:
- *shido*
- LuaJIT's dynamic library

WARNING: Other libraries are either not available or not guaranteed to be available.

== Supported platforms

The main targets are desktop platforms: *Windows* and *Linux*.

Ultimately, *Android* could be supported for mobile platforms.

*iOS* and *macOS* will probably never be supported because of their hostility towards JIT compilation and FFI (dynamic code generation/loading in general) which conflicts with the principles of the framework.

*Web* will probably never be supported because of the low-level requirements of the framework.
