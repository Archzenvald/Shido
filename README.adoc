Shido is a 3D game framework which aims to be simple and powerful. It is similar to projects like https://love2d.org/[LÃ–VE].

.The framework is made up of:
- A *C* API, the *shido* shared/dynamic library.
- A Lua(JIT) API, built on the *C* API.
- A runtime environment to launch an app.

NOTE: This way different levels of abstractions are available to get simplicity and control.

.The framework is built on some major dependencies:
- The https://github.com/google/filament[Filament] rendering engine.
- The https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3[Bullet Physics] engine.
- The http://luajit.org/luajit.html[LuaJIT] VM.
